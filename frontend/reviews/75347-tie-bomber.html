      <h2>Editorial Review (Revised)</h2>
      <h1>75347 TIE Bomber</h1>
      <h2>Editorial Summary</h2>
      <p>75347 TIE Bomber is one of the more straightforwardly successful Star Wars vehicle releases of its wave: recognizable shape language, useful minifigure support, and an enjoyable build sequence that does not overcomplicate its mission. Reviewers largely agree that LEGO captured the core profile and silhouette cues effectively enough for both shelf and play use. The set is often described as a practical, satisfying "classic Imperial ship" release rather than a radical redesign.</p>
      <p>Criticism appears in predictable areas for this class of model: sticker dependence, pricing pressure at full retail, and some calls for extra refinement in specific contours. Even so, sentiment across review outlets is mostly favorable.</p>
      <h2>What Reviewers Praise Most</h2>
      <p>The primary positive is identity clarity. The model reads immediately as a TIE Bomber, and that sounds obvious, but it is not trivial for ships with asymmetrical, pod-heavy geometry. Several reviews credit the build for preserving recognizability without becoming too fragile.</p>
      <p>The minifigure roster is another strength. Darth Vader and Rae Sloane create useful value for collectors interested in Imperial-era scene building. Even for buyers focused on the ship itself, the figure lineup improves perceived package depth and gives the set more replay options.</p>
      <p>Many reviewers also note that this is a comfortable build for a broad age range. It includes enough technique variation to stay engaging while avoiding the kind of complexity that narrows audience appeal.</p>
      <h2>Recurring Limitations</h2>
      <p>Sticker implementation is a common complaint. On dark, cleanly profiled ships, stickers can have outsize impact on finish quality. Builders sensitive to alignment imperfections may find this a persistent frustration.</p>
      <p>Price-to-content debate is also present. While not usually framed as extreme overpricing, reviewers frequently suggest stronger value appears once even moderate discounts are available.</p>
      <p>A third, softer criticism is that the set prioritizes usability and recognizability over deep technical intricacy. For many buyers that is a benefit, but for advanced display collectors it can feel conservative.</p>
      <h2>Audience Fit</h2>
      <p>Best fit:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Imperial-era fans wanting a classic ship with current-era build quality.</li>
      <li>Buyers who want a display-capable model that still handles well during play.</li>
      <li>Collectors who value minifigure relevance and scene utility.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Possibly skip/wait if:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>You dislike sticker-led finishes on dark vehicle surfaces.</li>
      <li>You are choosing between multiple ships and prioritizing high complexity per pound.</li>
      <li>You are strictly buying at full RRP and can wait for promotions.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Value-Over-Time Perspective</h2>
      <p>The review pattern suggests 75347 behaves like a dependable mid-tier purchase: solid quality floor, clearer upside at discount. Because the set's appeal is tied to iconic ship design rather than novelty gimmicks, it is less dependent on short launch-window excitement. That generally supports a patient-buy strategy for value-focused collectors.</p>
      <p>If your collection plan is Imperial-heavy, this set is often considered structurally useful enough to justify eventual ownership. The main variable is timing, not viability.</p>
      <h2>Bottom Line</h2>
      <p>75347 TIE Bomber is a strong, practical Star Wars set that gets its fundamentals right. It may not be the most technically ambitious release in the line, and sticker/price critiques are fair, but the broad review consensus remains positive. For many buyers, this is exactly what it should be: a recognizable, enjoyable Imperial vehicle with credible long-term shelf utility.</p>
